# What is this?

The notebook section is where we keep focused notes on the project. Each note is a single file, with a single purpose, written in markdown. You can have files on how to run a specific query or how to start a local server. It's developer docs for the project. They're kept with the project in git so we can see how they change over time.

## How many do I need?

Just create what you need.
